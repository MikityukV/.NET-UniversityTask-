# Find and Replace Task ( use file )

This code is part of a Windows Forms graphical user interface program. The application has three buttons - "Open File", "Save File", and "Find and Replace".

When the "Open File" button is clicked, a dialog window opens where the user can select a text file to open. Then the contents of the file are loaded into a text box on the form.

When the "Save File" button is clicked, a dialog window opens where the user can specify the name and location of the file to be saved. Then the contents of the text box are saved to the selected file.

When the "Find and Replace" button is clicked, the program searches and replaces all phone numbers in the text from the text box that match a given regular expression. Then, three random characters are replaced with asterisks, except for those that are dashes or have already been replaced. The result of the replacement is saved in the text box.
